Killer on the road, yeah
Sweet family will die
If you give this man a ride
Let your children play
Take a long holiday
His brain is squirmin' like a toad
There's a killer on the road

Riders on the storm
An actor out on loan
Like a dog without a bone
Into this world, we're thrown
Into this house, we're born
Riders on the storm
Riders on the storm
